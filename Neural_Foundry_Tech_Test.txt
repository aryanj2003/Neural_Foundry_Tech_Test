    Purpose:
        To convert a simple spoken command into a structured JSON object that defines
        a specific action, making it easier to interpret and execute commands programmatically.

    Parameters:
        text (str): The text string that contains the command to be mapped.

    Return Value:
        dict: A dictionary representing the action to be taken. If the command is recognized,
              it returns the corresponding JSON object; if not, it returns a JSON object with
              an "error" key indicating the command is unknown.
